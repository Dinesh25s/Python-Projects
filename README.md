# Amazon Web Scraping using Python

## The Project is Mainly Bulding to Scrape The Data of Various Products From the Amazon Website using Python Beautiful Soup Library.

### Some Of The Most Important Key Points Which I used in this Project to do Web Scraping from Amazon Website scrape data from the amazon website and convert it into CSV file format.

1. Insatalling Python Library(Beautiful Soup)

2. Installing Python Package(Pandas,NumPy)

3. Before Starting Any Web Scraping Projects We have to know that What is your User-Agent.

4. If you dont Know the User-agent of our pc/laptop you have to go through this link to get your user-agent link("https://www.whatismybrowser.com/") 

5. After that you Have to Send Requset to Amazon Website

6. Check the Response of the webpage if it is coming like <Respone[200]> or showing error.

7. The data Coming from the website is in bytes we have to convert it into a proper html format we have to use beatifulSoup Library.

8. After that We have to find all (A-tag) in the html to find out the requird href link

9. After that we have to take one link to extract the data from the website if the data is coming in correct way or not

10. if the Data is comming in a Correct Formate then we have to do loop to extrct all the data from  the differnt links
